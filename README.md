# CoroniReisen

Hi!

This is the repository for the App CoroniReisen.

This App was made to help people in their search for their next **safe** trip's destination.

Nevertheless, this doesn't mean we support traveling in the middle of a pandemic, but if you ABSOLUTELY must, then this App was made to help you.

All you have to do, is enter the Name of a country and you'll get it shown in the map. If you want to know the details, then click on the marker shown on the map and you'll be redirected to the country Covid-19 details.

There you'll find if the country is considered as a risk area (by german standards), as well as the latest numbers related to Covid-19.

[Here](documentation/guidance.md) you can find how to use the App.

*We do **not** approve traveling during this pandemic!*

- When the app starts you see this screen. The user is welcomed and the purpose of the app is briefly explained. 
- A note indicates that the image with the protective measures must be clicked.
- These protective measures have been adopted by the German Social Accident Insurance, as described below in the source. 
- The interface is built with a ScrollView and CardViews. Therefore, the individual cards can be used. When clicking the middle card, 
you will be redirected to the next view.

## MainActivity
- When the app starts you see this screen. The user is welcomed and the purpose of the app is briefly explained. 
- A note indicates that the image with the protective measures must be clicked.
- These protective measures have been adopted by the German Social Accident Insurance, as described below in the source. 
- The interface is built with a ScrollView and CardViews. Therefore, the individual cards can be used. When clicking the middle card, 
you will be redirected to the next view. 

**This interface serves as a start page.**

## MapFragment
- This interface allows the user to further narrow down their vacation destination. 
You can either search for a single country and display it on the map, or select one of the buttons on the 2nd cardview. 

- If you search for a single country with the search button, a marker is set on the mapview below. This marker can be deleted if you keep it pressed for a longer time. If the user presses the marker, he will be forwarded directly to the country details for this country.

- The buttons on the 2nd cardview represent vacation categories. Via these buttons you will be forwarded to a country selection. 

**This interface serves as input of the country to be specified.**
